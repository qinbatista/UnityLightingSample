1: realtime light can cast realtime shadow, but it is very accurate, be care about the hole from model
2: baked light is always accurate
3: Reflect Prob static is effect on reflection ball
4: Emission: GI static can cause emission
5: Emission: must be GI static, must enable GI emission in material, must has higher than 1 intensity
6: Emission light generates very soft shadow
